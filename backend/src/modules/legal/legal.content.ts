/**
 * Legal content.
 *
 * Served both as JSON (for the in-app screens) and as a plain public HTML page
 * — Google Play requires a privacy policy at a URL that works without logging
 * in, and a link into the app does not satisfy that.
 *
 * Written specifically for what AdiOne actually does. Two things it is careful
 * NOT to claim, because they would be untrue for this build:
 *   - it does not promise round-the-clock support (the shop trades 8am-10pm);
 *   - it does not claim card details are stored securely, because none are
 *     ever collected — UPI payments happen entirely inside the customer's own
 *     bank app.
 *
 * NOT LEGAL ADVICE. Have a lawyer review before launch, and fill in the
 * placeholders marked {{ }} with the registered business details.
