 * Two implementations:
 *   - `redis`  — production. Survives restarts, shared across processes.
 *   - `memory` — local development only. The environment loader REFUSES to
 *                boot in production with this driver, because per-process
 *                state would let a restart wipe every rate-limit counter and
 *                let two processes disagree about an OTP.
 *
 * Deliberately a small surface: only what the app actually needs. A larger
 * interface would make the memory implementation a re-implementation of Redis.
