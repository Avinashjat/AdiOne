/**
 * UPI intent provider — pay directly to the shop's VPA.
 *
 * HOW THIS DIFFERS FROM A PAYMENT GATEWAY:
 *
 * A `upi://pay?...` deep link hands the customer to their own UPI app.
 * The money moves directly into the shop's account. There is NO callback,
 * NO webhook and NO provider API that can reliably tell this server that
 * the payment succeeded.
 *
 * Therefore this provider deliberately does NOT automatically verify payment.
 * The customer can return to the app after attempting payment, but the order
 * remains pending until an authorized admin confirms that the money was
 * actually received in the merchant's UPI/bank account.
